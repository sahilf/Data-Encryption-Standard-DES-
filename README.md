# Data Encryption Standard(DES)

The DES algorithm is the most popular security algorithm. It's a symmetric algorithm, which means that the same keys are used to encrypt/decrypt sensitive data. Hence, the aim of this project is to implement DES Algorithm for encryption and decryption of data. 
The code is in Python.
